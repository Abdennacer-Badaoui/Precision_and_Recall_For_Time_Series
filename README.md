# Precision_and_Recall_For_Time_Series

Anomaly detection in time series data has traditionally focused on identifying point-based anomalies—deviations occurring at a single moment in time. However, many real-world applications involve range-based anomalies, where anomalous behavior spans a continuous period. In this project, we studied a novel mathematical framework proposed by N Tatbul. in the paper “Precision and Recall for Time Series”. for evaluating the performance of time series classification algorithms. This framework extends the classical Precision and Recall metrics to account for range-based anomalies, providing a more comprehensive evaluation methodology. Our objective was to implement this model from scratch, reproduce the results presented in the paper, and conduct novel experiments to evaluate the influence of different functions within this framework on the calculated metrics
